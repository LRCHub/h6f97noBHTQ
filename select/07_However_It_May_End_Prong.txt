Ah it's looking like a lost cause
Beyond today
It's looking like a lost cause beyond today

Ah, call of confidence, selling your precedent
Stay in your prison state of mind
With due prominence, no letter of consequence
There's no future to rely

Designs that confine, pressure 'til the end
Polarize, we'll defy, however it may end

Ah, it's looking like a lost cause
Beyond today
It's looking like a lost cause beyond today

Have no evidence, and genuine my defense
Our clever voices will align
We'll let in the presidents
Becoming evidence
All gone, eventual demise

Designs that confine, pressure 'til the end
Polarize, we'll defy, however it may end

However it may end

Pressure 'til the end
Never took a damn
Forever took to them
However it may end

More scars appear on my face
Causing more scars to the future state
A lost cause of the past
Looking like a lost cause in the end

Designs that confine, pressure 'til the end
Polarize, we'll defy, however it may end

Designs that confine
Polarize, we'll defy, however it may end

Ah, it's looking like a lost cause
Beyond today
