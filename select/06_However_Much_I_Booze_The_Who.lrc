[00:14.57] I see myself on T.V., I'm a faker, a paper clown
[00:21.93] It's clear to all my friends that I habitually lie; I just bring them down
[00:29.28] I claim proneness to exaggeration
[00:33.81] But the truth lies in my frustration
[00:37.44] The children of the night, they all pass me by
[00:41.22] Have to drench myself in brandy
[00:43.01] In sleep I'll hide
[00:46.66] But however much I booze
[00:49.46] There ain't no way out
[00:53.95] There ain't no way out
[00:58.51] I don't care what you say, boy
[01:00.37] There ain't no way out
[01:11.37] 
[01:10.42] I lose so many nights of sleep worrying about my responsibilities
[01:17.69] Are the problems that screw me up really down to him or me
[01:24.93] My ego will just confuse me
[01:28.62] Some day it's going to up and use me
[01:32.27] Dish me out another tailor-made compliment
[01:36.09] Tell me about some destiny I can't prevent
[01:42.50] And however much I squirm
[01:44.31] There ain't no way out
[01:48.92] There ain't no way out
[01:53.52] I don't care what you say, boy
[01:56.30] There ain't no way out
[02:07.30] 
[02:11.79] Won't somebody tell me how to get out of this place?!
[02:38.29] 
[02:44.36] Then the night comes down like a cell door closing
[02:50.66] Suddenly I realize that I'm right now, I'm on the scene
[02:58.84] While sitting here all alone with a bottle and my head a-floating
[03:06.11] Far away from the phone and the conscience going on at me
[03:12.67] And on at me, and I don't care what you say
[03:16.21] There ain't no way out
[03:19.82] There ain't no way out
[03:30.82] 
[03:25.54] Now the walls are all clawed and scratched
[03:28.24] Like by some soul insane
[03:32.81] In the morning I humbly detach myself
[03:36.45] I take no blame
[03:40.18] I just can't face my failure
[03:43.73] I'm nothing but a well fucked sailor
[03:47.36] You at home can easily decide what's right
[03:51.05] By glancing very briefly at the songs I write
[03:57.49] But it don't help me that you know
[04:00.12] This ain't no way out
[04:03.86] Won't somebody tell me?
[04:08.37] I don't care what you say, boy
[04:11.05] There ain't no way out
[04:22.05] 
[04:20.16] There ain't no way out
[04:22.00] There ain't no way out
[04:24.77] There ain't no way out
[04:35.77] 
[04:28.34] Give me the key, lock it away
[04:42.84] 
[04:39.30] There ain't
[04:41.17] There ain't
[04:42.95] There ain't no way out
[04:44.72] There ain't no way out
[04:47.90] There ain't no way out
